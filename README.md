This is a battle tank game where you have a lot of worlds to play.<br>

## worlds
A world was modeling by a vector of positions, where each component vector is the height from the ground, changing the vector will change the world.
The floor was built using the linear equation of a straight applied to adjacents points in the world vector.

## tank
A tank has its own velocity, health and its own (and maybe) unique way of shotting.
Shotting can be doing with differents angles.

## projectile
It was implemented with the equation of projectile motion.
A projectile make a certain amount of damage when it impacts another tank.
